> ## General Information
-As per given scenario 
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

   1- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

   2- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

# What is the background of your project?
The background of the scenario described is related to the operations of a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. This type of company typically provides financial services to individuals or households, offering loans for purposes such as personal expenses, home improvements, education, or debt consolidation.
Consumer finance companies play a crucial role in the lending industry by providing accessible financing options to individuals who may not qualify for traditional bank loans or who prefer alternative lending sources. These companies often cater to a specific target market, such as urban customers in this case.
The background assumes that the company receives loan applications from potential borrowers and must assess the creditworthiness of each applicant. This involves evaluating various factors, such as the applicant's income, employment history, credit score, and overall financial profile. The objective is to determine the likelihood of repayment and the potential risks associated with approving or denying a loan.
The risks mentioned in the scenario highlight the potential consequences of the company's loan approval decisions. If the company approves a loan for an applicant who is not likely to repay it, there is a risk of financial loss for the company due to potential defaults. On the other hand, if the company denies a loan to an applicant who is likely to repay, there is a risk of losing business opportunities.
To manage these risks, the consumer finance company must employ sound risk assessment and mitigation strategies. This includes implementing thorough evaluation processes, utilizing data analysis and credit scoring models, and complying with regulatory requirements to ensure responsible lending practices.
The background sets the stage for understanding the context in which the company operates and the key challenges it faces in making loan approval decisions while balancing risks and business opportunities.

# What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?-
- As per given scenario
-    1- Loan accepted: If the company approves the loan, there are 3 possible scenarios described below:

        Fully paid: Applicant has fully paid the loan (the principal and the interest rate)

        Current: Applicant is in the process of paying the instalments, i.e. the tenure of the loan is not yet completed. These candidates are not labelled as 'defaulted'.

        Charged-off: Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan 
  2- Loan rejected: The company had rejected the loan (because the candidate does not meet their requirements etc.). Since the loan was rejected, there is no transactional history of those applicants with the company and so this data is not available with the company (and thus in this dataset)

# What is the dataset that is being used?
- We are using two datasetet in this project which are in "csv" format and available in project's loan_doc folder which are "loan.csv" and "Data_Dictionary.xlsx" but our main dataset is "loan.csv" which have all information about loan for a person and "Data_Dictionary.xlsx" contain only full farm of "loan.csv" table header.
